# Stealth Wallet

Stealth Wallet is a JavaScript application that enables users to employ stealth addresses on the Ethereum network, providing increased privacy for transactions. By using stealth addresses, senders can avoid direct interaction with a specific entity, and recipients can remain anonymous. This project is based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) [ERC-5564](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5564) and [ERC-6538](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6538).

Find the application deployed at [stealth-wallet.xyz](https://stealth-wallet.xyz/) and a simple tutorial on stealth addresses [here](https://nerolation.github.io/stealth-utils/).
